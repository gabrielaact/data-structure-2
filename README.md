The function checks if any two numbers in an input array sum up to a target sum, with an O(N) complexity. 

We need to write a function that thake in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
